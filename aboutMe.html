        <p id="aboutMeText">My name is Isaac Torres and I am currently a college student majoring in Computer Science at California State University, Monterey Bay. Throughout my years as a college student I have been able to grow and diversify as a programmer and person. I use my passion for computer programming to help others and build strong relationships and connections with my fellow peers. Helping others and giving back to my community is a trait I have held since my high school years where I was given the opportunity to teach a course on game development at my very first internship opportunity. Whether itâ€™s through my video game projects or simply working on homework assignments with friends, I am always trying to make an impact and give back. I have been programming and creating video games since my freshman year of high school. My passion for game development has pushed me to pursue a career in computer science. It is my dream to ultimately join a game studio where I will be able to create interesting and engaging projects working alongside talent from the industry. </p>
